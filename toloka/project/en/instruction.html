<br>
<div class="wiki-p"> Two titles are called <b>the same</b> if they are about the same things or differ from each other in minor details.</div>
<br>
<div class="wiki-p"> The first title <b>causes</b> the second title if the second title is impossible without the first one. That is, if the first event didn't happen, then the second event should not be happining too. Examples: opinions, details, comments, true causes. <b> This relationship should be ovbious from the titles only.</b></div>
<br>
<div class="wiki-p"> The second title <b>refutes</b> the first one if the second title makes the first one irrelevant. Examples: refutations, updates in death tool, updates in match score. <b>This relationship should be ovbious from the titles only.</b></div>
<br>
<div class="wiki-p"> <b>Other</b> possible relationships include the same characters, titles with the same cause, titles with unknown order. <b> This relationship should be chosen in case if you are in doubt. </b></div>
